                <p>On the Application tab, you can edit settings in the loaded config version. At login, the settings for the active config are loaded. The values in the active config are applied across servers as a part of the overall application configuration.</p>
                <p>In an SMP installation, the application configuration is comprised of two major parts:</p>
                <ul>
                
                <li>Active config. Collection of settings and content instructions the server is to apply in the runtime environment (for example, test modules and workflow modules).</li>
                <li>Config items are items your team can create from the Application tab of Configuration Manager. Upon saving and publishing from there, a new version of the config is created and made active.</li>
                <li>Content. Individual items on which settings in the active config depend for execution (for example, models, overlays, and workflows) and other resources on which the content itself depends</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In general, content items are items that your team authors from applicable SMP tools, such as Model Builder, Overlay Builder, and Workflow Builder.</p>
